 The issue of privacy in digital space is currently a widely discussed topic.
Questions asked to technology companies are often met with the loud assurance that all data shared is anonymous and confidential information is immediately removed from the system.
Nothing could be more wrong. In fact, the situation is completely different. that's why the Proximus cryptocurrency was created, through to which you can know that you are anonymous.

Your payments are not identifiable because the technology uses a ring signature in which we have a group of people each with their own secret and public key. Typical cryptocurrencies do not have this feature, so their payments can be easily traced, did you know that? Much work has been devoted to Bitcoin block chain analysis. Their authors track the flow of money, identify the owners of coins, determine the balance of the wallet and so on. In our case, this is impossible because our code is not explicit.

   #                                             Untraceable payments
   
proximus uses ring signatures technology thanks to which it mixes different results
of similar value in one transaction, therefore it is impossible to deduce from where
money come from.

   #                                           Unlinkable transactions
   
​Proximus generates many addresses that are one-off so they cannot be read
from one set of keys. therefore connection cannot be established
between transactions or addresses.

​

   #                                        blockchain analysis resistance
   
through to cryptonote technology Each payment address is a unique one-time key, coming from two data senders and a recipient.
It can include twice with the probability of a 256-bit hash collision. Therefore, Proximus is immune to blockchain analysis.

   #                                           Proximus is decentralized
   
Proximus cryptocurrency uses decentralized control as opposed to centralized digital currencies and central banking systems.
The decentralized control of each cryptocurrency works through distributed book technology, usually blockchain,
which serves as a database of public financial transactions.
