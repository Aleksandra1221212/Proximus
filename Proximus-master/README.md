The issue of privacy in the digital space is a widely discussed subject in these times. Questions asked to technology companies often meet with loud assurances that any shared data is anonymous, and confidential information is immediately removed from the system. Nothing could be more wrong. In fact, the situation looks completely different.
that's why I decided to create a Proximus cryptocurrency thanks to her you can know that you are anonymous
Proximus is not a token we know that there is really a lot of them and some are useless  although  there are many of them really good .It is a cryptocurrency based on blockchain technology,  like for example Bitcoin.
                            
                                       what will you gain by having proximus?
 
your payments are impossible to track bicouse the technology uses the ring signature, in which we have a group of people, each of whom has their own secret and public key. Common cryptocurrencies do not have this function, therefore their payments can be easily traced
resistance to analysis- Do you know ?There is a lot of work devoted to Bitcoin block chain analysis. Their authors follow the flow of money, identify the owners of coins, determine the balance of the portfolio and so on. In our case, it is impossible because our code is not explicit.
The ultimate goal of Proximus is to become the best anonymous cryptocurrency in the world.
